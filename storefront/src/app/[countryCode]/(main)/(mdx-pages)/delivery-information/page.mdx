# Delivery Information

## Shipping Policy

Our promise to our customers is that we try to deliver your goods the same day for next-day delivery if you order before 1 PM. All items are located here in the UK. We do not do drop shipping. Shipment will be via either Royal Mail or UK Mail.

Orders are generally shipped on the day of purchase if bought before 1 PM, but we may ship 1 day after full payment is received.  Most times, we ship out the following day. We ship by next-day delivery service.

We only ship Mondays - Fridays. We do not ship weekends. If you do not receive your item two days after purchase (excluding weekends), contact us and we will follow it up.

Please note that in some very rare circumstances, the courier companies may delay the delivery time of your item. We will do our best to follow up on any delays by the shipping company. Please bear with us if this happens.
